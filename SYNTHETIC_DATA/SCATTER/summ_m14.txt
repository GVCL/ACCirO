The plot depicts a Scatter Graph illustrating scatter plot. The plot is between yaxis on y-axis over xaxis on the x-axis for type1, type2, and type3 varients. The yaxis of type1 has it maximum and minmum values 485 and 14 at xaxis 39, and 72 respectively. The yaxis of type2 has it maximum and minmum values 421 and 10 at xaxis 26, and 38 respectively. The yaxis of type3 has it maximum and minmum values 479 and 33 at xaxis 57, and 89 respectively. The xaxis and yaxis doesn't exhibit any correlation for catogeries 'type1', type2', and 'type3' .
