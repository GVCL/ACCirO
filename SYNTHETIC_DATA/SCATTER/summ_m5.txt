The plot depicts a Scatter Graph illustrating scatter plot. The plot is between yaxis on y-axis over xaxis on the x-axis for type1, and type2 varients. The yaxis of type1 has it maximum and minmum values 1 and -11 at xaxis 3, and 10 respectively. The yaxis of type2 has it maximum and minmum values 5 and -10 at xaxis 3, and 6 respectively. The xaxis and yaxis doesn't exhibit any correlation for catogeries 'type1', and 'type2' .
