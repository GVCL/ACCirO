The plot depicts a Scatter Graph illustrating student test grades. The plot is between test scores on y-axis over time spent studying on the x-axis for class 1, and class 2 varients. For the time spent studying ranging form 1 - 8 at the interval 2, the test scores of class 1 are 35, 50, 65, 82, 90, and 99 respectively. For the time spent studying ranging form 1 - 8 at the interval 2, the test scores of class 2 are 85, 90, 92, 95, 97, and 100 respectively. The time spent studying and test scores are positively correlated for catogeries 'class 1', and 'class 2' with spearman correlation values 1.0, and 1.0 respectively .
