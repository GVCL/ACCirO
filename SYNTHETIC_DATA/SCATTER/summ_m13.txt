The plot depicts a Scatter Graph illustrating scatter plot. The plot is between x axis on y-axis over xaxis on the x-axis for type1, type2, and type3 varients. The x axis of type1 has it maximum and minmum values 488 and 75 at xaxis 135, and 71 respectively. The x axis of type2 has it maximum and minmum values 980 and 188 at xaxis 80, and 150 respectively. The x axis of type3 has it maximum and minmum values 839 and 30 at xaxis 80, and 97 respectively. The xaxis and x axis are negatively correlated for the catogery 'type3' with spearman correlation value -0.52.
