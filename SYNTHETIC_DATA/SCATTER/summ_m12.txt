The plot depicts a Scatter Graph illustrating scatter plot. The plot is between x axis on y-axis over xaxis on the x-axis for type1, and type2 varients. The x axis of type1 has it maximum and minmum values 92 and 5 at xaxis 12, and 11 respectively. The x axis of type2 has it maximum and minmum values 97 and 21 at xaxis 11, and 16 respectively. The xaxis and x axis doesn't exhibit any correlation for catogeries 'type1', and 'type2' .
