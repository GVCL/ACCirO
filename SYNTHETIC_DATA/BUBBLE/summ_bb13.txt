The plot depicts a Bubble Plot Graph illustrating lower secondary class statistics. The plot is between richest wealth quintile on y-axis over poorest wealth quintile on the x-axis for developed less, least, and more varients. The richest wealth quintile of developed less has it maximum and minmum values 6 and 0 at poorest wealth quintile 28, and 0 respectively. For the poorest wealth quintile ranging form 45 - 15 at the interval 2, the richest wealth quintile of least are 4, 12, 3, 9, 15, and 2 respectively. For the poorest wealth quintile with 5 the richest wealth quintile of more is 0. The poorest wealth quintile and richest wealth quintile are positively correlated for catogeries 'developed less', and 'least' with spearman correlation values 0.53, and 0.53 respectively .
