The plot depicts a Bubble Plot Graph illustrating conditions of heart failure people at age 58. The plot is between cholesterol on y-axis over restingbp on the x-axis for lvh, normal, and st varients. The cholesterol of lvh has it maximum and minmum values 320 and 216 at restingbp 136, and 128 respectively. For the restingbp ranging form 130 - 179 at the interval 30, the cholesterol of normal are 263, 235, 218, 204, 198, and 392 respectively. For the restingbp ranging form 130 - 160 at the interval 7, the cholesterol of st are 211, 232, 219, 319, 166, and 212 respectively. The restingbp and cholesterol doesn't exhibit any correlation for catogeries 'lvh', normal', and 'st' .
