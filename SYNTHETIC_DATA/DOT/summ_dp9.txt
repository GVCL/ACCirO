The plot depicts a Dot Plot Graph illustrating regionewise sales trends per year. The plot is between sales i millionj on y-axis over year on the x-axis for central, west, and east. For the year ranging form 2015 - 2019 at the interval 1, the sales i millionj of central are 2, 3, 2, 4, and 2 respectively. For the year ranging form 2015 - 2019 at the interval 1, the sales i millionj of west are 2, 3, 6, 5, and 2 respectively. For the year ranging form 2015 - 2019 at the interval 1, the sales i millionj of east are 4, 6, 4, 3, and 1 respectively.
	The sales i millionj differnce between central and west starts with 0 at year 2015 the minimum value then declines till 2017 the maximum value, and ends with a decreasing trend till 2019. The sales i millionj differnce between central and east starts with 2 at year 2015 then declines till 2016 the maximum value, and ends with a decreasing trend till 2019. The sales i millionj differnce between west and east starts with -2 at year 2015 then declines till 2016 the minimum value, and ends with a decreasing trend till 2019. For the year ranging form 2015 - 2019 at the interval 1, the sales i millionj of all catogeries cummulatively are 8, 12, 12, 12, and 5 respectively. The standard deviation values of sales i millionj for catogeries 'central', west', and 'east' are 0.8, 1.62, and 1.62 respectively .
