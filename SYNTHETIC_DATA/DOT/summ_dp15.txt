The plot depicts a Dot Plot Graph illustrating playerls success vs failure count. The plot is between count on y-axis over player on the x-axis for success, and failure. The count of success starts with 3 at player 1 then declines till 3 the minimum value, followed by an increasing trend till 6, followed by an increasing trend till 10 the maximum value, and finally ends with 4 in 11. The count of failure starts with 6 at player 1 the maximum value then increases till 7, followed by a decreasing trend till 8 the minimum value, and ends with a decreasing trend till 11.
	The count of all catogeries cummulatively starts with 9 at player 1 then declines till 3, followed by a decreasing trend till 8 the minimum value, followed by an increasing trend till 10 the maximum value, and finally ends with 9 in 11. The standard deviation values of count for catogeries 'success', and 'failure' are 2.23, and 1.48 respectively .
